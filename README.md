# Qu3ECsharp
A CSharp Port of Randy Gauls Qu3E 3D Physics Engine. 
This Port is still in very early stage of development. I am doing this port at my leisure time to gain an understanding on How a Physics Engines Work. Thus, this port is purely for educational purpose.

Refer the original Version written in C++ to learn more about Qu3E.
